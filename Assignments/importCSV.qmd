# Objective

In this assignment, you will learn how to import a CSV file containing earthquake data into QGIS, use Latitude and Longitude columns to display the data as points, and visualize the spatial distribution of earthquakes.  

---

# Dataset  

- File: **earthquake.csv**  
- Contents: The dataset includes earthquake records with columns such as:  

- `ID` – Unique identifier for each earthquake  
- `Date` – Date of occurrence  
- `Latitude` – Latitude coordinate of epicenter  
- `Longitude` – Longitude coordinate of epicenter  
- `Magnitude` – Earthquake magnitude (Richter scale)  
- `Depth` – Depth of earthquake in kilometers  

---

# Instructions  

## Step 1: Open QGIS  
- Launch **QGIS Desktop** from your computer.  
- Create a **new empty project** (*Project → New*).  

## Step 2: Load the CSV file  
- Go to **Layer → Add Layer → Add Delimited Text Layer**.  
- Browse and select the file **earthquake.csv**.  
- Ensure the **File format** is set to *CSV (comma separated values)*.  
- Verify that QGIS correctly detects the delimiter (comma).  

## Step 3: Set the Geometry  
- In the dialog, look for the **Geometry Definition** section.  
- Choose **Point coordinates**.  
- Set:  
  - **X field** = `Longitude`  
  - **Y field** = `Latitude`  
- Click **Add** → then **Close**.  
- The earthquake points should now appear on the map canvas.  

## Step 4: Check Coordinate Reference System (CRS)  
- At the bottom-right corner of QGIS, click the CRS indicator.  
- Set CRS to **EPSG:4326 – WGS 84** (standard for latitude/longitude).  
- Confirm that the points are displayed properly.  

## Step 5: Style the Map  
- In the **Layers Panel**, right-click on the imported earthquake layer → **Properties**.  
- Go to the **Symbology** tab.  
- Change the symbol size based on **Magnitude** (use *Graduated* symbology).  
- Choose a color ramp (e.g., Yellow → Red, where red shows higher magnitude).  
- Apply and check your visualization.  

## Step 6: Add a Base Map  
- Go to **Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins**.  
- Search for **QuickMapServices** and install it.  
- Go to **Web → QuickMapServices → OSM → OSM Standard** to add a base map.  
- Earthquake points should now overlay on a real-world basemap.  

## Step 7: Save Your Project and Export Map  
- Save your project as **earthquake_project.qgz**.  
- To export a map:  
  - Go to **Project → New Print Layout**.  
  - Add the map to the layout.  
  - Insert a **Title, Legend, Scale bar, and North arrow**.  
  - Export your final map as **PDF or PNG**.

# Deliverables  

Submit the following:  

1. Your **QGIS project file** (`earthquake_project.qgz`).  
2. A **map output** (PDF/PNG) showing the spatial distribution of earthquakes 
3. A short note (200–300 words) describing the pattern of earthquakes you observe.
